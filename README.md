## 1.Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

## 2.Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculates the final price after applying a discount.
    
    Parameters:
    price (float): The original price of the item.
    discount_percent (float): The discount percentage to be applied.
    
    Returns:
    float: The final price after applying the discount if it's 20% or higher,
           otherwise returns the original price.
    """
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = (discount_percent / 100) * price
        return price - discount_amount
    return price

original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate final price
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percent)

# Display the result
if discount_percent >= 20:
    print(f"The final price after a {discount_percent}% discount is: {final_price:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"No discount applied. The price remains: {original_price:.2f}")
